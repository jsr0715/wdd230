            <p>Contrast is one of the most powerful design concepts of them all because really any design element can be contrasted with another. Making use of contrast can help you create a design in which one item is clearly dominant. This helps the viewer get the point of your design quickly. </p></div>

            <h2>Proximity</h2>

            </picture>
            <p>he principle of proximity is about moving things closer or farther apart to achieve a more organized look. The principle says that related items should be rouped together so that they will be viewed as a group, rather than as several unrelated elemetns. Audiences will assume that items that are not near each other in a design are not closely related. Audiences will naturally tend to group similar items that are near to each other into a single unit. </p>

            <h2>Repetition</h2>

            <img src="hyundai.jpg" alt="repetition"/>
            </picture>
            <p>The principle of repetition simply menas the reusing of the same or similar elements throughout your design. Repetition of certain design elements in a slide or among a deck of slides will bring a clear sense of unity, consistency, and cohesiveness. Where contrast is about showing differences, repetition is about subtly using elements to amek sure the design is viewed as being apart of a larger whole. </p>
